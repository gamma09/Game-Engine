Milestone 2: Develop a basic reflection library for the editor.

Status: Completed and tested.

Implementation is in:
Reflection\Reflection_Headers
Reflection\Reflection_Tool

Things I learned:
1. Fuck Reflection
2. A whole shit ton of obscure syntax for templates of templates and variable argument/parameter lists for EVERYTHING
3. FUCK REFLECTION
4. How to create a custom build tool and add it to the build process
5. SERIOUSLY FUCK REFLECTION
6. How to create stdin/out/err file pipes along with how to fork a process in Windows (its rather painful)
7. ...The output of the code below:

int main()
{
	printf( "Fuck %s in the ass", "Reflection" );
	return 0;
}
